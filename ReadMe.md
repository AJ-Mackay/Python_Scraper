Notes:
I decided to try this exercise using Python. I noticed that one of the classes in a div had a typo, so I found a work around. It was fun figuring out why the scraper was returning 19 instead of 20 products, but was easily solved once I figured out there was a missing letter and how to chain search queries together.

I have not been able to get the formatting exactly the same for the json output as shown in the original e-mail, such as:
* additional indentation at the start of the metadata below the product name,
* not showing the quotation marks around the image Urls, and
* price does not display all decimal places when saved as type float.
