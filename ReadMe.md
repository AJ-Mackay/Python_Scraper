To Do List:

* Scrape Website
* Download Products
* Convert to JSON

Notes:
I decided to try this exercise using Python. I noticed that one of the classes in a div had a typo, but found a work around. It was fun figuring out why the scraper was returning 19 instead of 20 products, but was easily solved once I figured out there was a missing letter and how to chain search categories together.

I'm sure there has to be an easy method of showing both decimal places where they exist (Eggs, Flour, Ice Cubes), and only one where they don't (Oranges), but I can get back to that later.
